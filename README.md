# VapeX Logo Design Journal

Logo design for a website that sells a variety of different vapers. This project idea is something I will be developing during the upcoming months with a friend of mine. I will be in charge of the technical side, i.e creating the website, the logo and so forth.

We came up with the name Vapex because we felt it was essential that our name contained the word vape in it, especially for social media purposes. 

We wanted to give a techy futuristic vibe to the logo se we immediately went for a sort of futuristic font. Our main inspiration was the Tesla logo and you can see a lot of similarities between both. To begin, I created a variety of letters just to feel out what where the posibilities having in mind the tesla font aesthetic, this is what I came up with.


Then, we tried a variety of different combinations for these letters and did some surveying with friends and family to see what people like the most.

This would eventually be the winner of the surveying. Initially we had only planned to do it in black, to keep it simple, but we then thought that also an alternative more bright colorway could be useful for the website or instagram, while we would keep the original black logo for labeling of our product.

We decided to give a ruby effect to the letters, not for any particular reason, it just came naturally to us. This is how the original logo looked with the ruby effect.

After this, we decided to implement color into it, I thought that a gradient colorway could make it pop out while still keeping the design a bit clean, not too flashy (this tends to make stuff end up looking cheap).

Blue-rose was the first gradient we came up with, and it looked quite nice, next step was to mess aroung with the border line thickness and color. We tried black and white and these were the results:


After doing a second survey fot this alternative design the fan favourite was this one:
